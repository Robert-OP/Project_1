# Project_1
Remote Control Food Dispenser for Pets

This project is in progress...

The following milestones will be attempted, such that the final project will feed pets be more happier:

Milestone 1: Done with a RaspBerry Pi 2 model B - check Milestone_1
- "Hello, world!" application on the target platform - e.g. the ability to flash a LED on the Arduino UNO from a Nabto client application
- Prepare a blog and have written an initial "basics" article (and in that way you also have the blog platform up and running).


Milestone 2: 
- Remote control the actual dispenser and adding more functionality in the client

Milestone 3: 
- Final product 
- Publish the article
